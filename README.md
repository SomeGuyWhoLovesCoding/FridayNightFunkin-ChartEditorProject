# Friday Night Funkin - Chart Editor Project

A repository of the rewritten chart editor, which'll have a **step-based bpm change system**, and most importantly, **Tab buttons with contents inside** that lead to a popup that can be closable.

## What the original Friday Night Funkin chart editor project was

There were a couple major problems with psych's and vanilla's, and since the flixel ui library was used,
the game's memory constantly increases due to the ui sprites being redrawn every frame.

### Problems:

- Vanilla and psych: The charting grid was only a section long, which regenerates when you go to the next section, which also costs increasing your memory.
- In psych: The chart editor waveform regenerates also when you go to the next section. Yet again, costs increasing your memory. Plus, why would you need a chart waveform anyway?

So we're gonna fix those 2 problems by rewriting the whole chart editor which is in this repository.

## How to contribute:

DM me on discord (@someguywhouhhhh) and ask me if you want to contribute to the chart editor project.
I will respond with "*Are you ready for this? Because our team needs you so that we can finish the project together!*", or "*Are you an experienced haxe coder? We're currently focusing on optimization and having the minimum memory usage as possible.*"
Make sure to be prepared for this because we'll be working VERY hard on the project!
